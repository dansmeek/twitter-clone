Just Another Twitter Clone
==========================

This is just another twitter clone that has probably been done a thousand times before.
For easy setup:

bundle install
rake db:migrate
rake db:seed


Features
========
The a very basic template mimicking the twitter framework.

Problems
=========
Various caching methods should be set up.    Implementing a seperate controller for search would allow some unique
querying based on each posts user id, hastag (if there is one), and referencing userids.  You could take this further
and implement an algorithm mimicking the "trending topics."

Other Areas
===========
A user profile could easily be setup, and include everything from customized css, to wherever your imagination takes 
you.   You could also strip out features that are unnecessary for your project and combine it with RESTKit.
